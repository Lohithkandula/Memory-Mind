# Memory-Mind

Memory Mind is a web application designed to help improve your memory skills using spaced repetition.

#Overview

Memory Mind uses spaced repetition to help you memorize information more effectively. The application allows you to create flashcards for any topic and then quizzes you on the information using a spaced repetition algorithm. As you answer questions correctly, the system increases the time between quizzes, allowing you to focus on the information you haven't yet memorized.
